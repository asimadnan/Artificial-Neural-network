# Artificial-Neural-network

This is a Feedforward neural network

you can initalize any arbitrarly sized neural network with this.
inputs needed is

number of inputs.
number of outputs
number of hidden layers and num of neuron in each hidden layer

the weights can be initialized randomly or can be given in an array.

the feedforward function will take inputs and give outputs.

the back propogation function isnt built completly any help would be highly appreciated.
